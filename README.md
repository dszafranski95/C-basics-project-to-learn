# C Basics Project

Welcome to my C Basics Project repository! This is where I’ll be creating various projects in the C programming language to learn it from the ground up.

## Why C?

I already have experience with JavaScript and Python, but I want to master the fundamentals of C to prepare for writing games in Unity and C#. Learning C will:

* Help me understand low-level programming concepts such as pointers, memory management, and data structures.
* Give me a solid foundation for exploring performance-critical code.
* Make it easier to pick up C# and other languages in the future.

## Project Structure

Each subdirectory will contain a standalone C project, focusing on a specific topic or feature, such as:

* `hello_world/` – Basic program structure and I/O.
* `pointers/` – Working with pointers and references.
* `memory_management/` – Dynamic allocation, `malloc` and `free`.
* `data_structures/` – Implementing linked lists, stacks, and queues.
* `file_io/` – Reading from and writing to files.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dszafranski95/C-basics-project-to-learn.git
   ```
2. Navigate into a project folder, for example:

   ```bash
   cd hello_world
   ```
3. Compile the code:

   ```bash
   gcc hello_world.c -o hello_world
   ```
4. Run the executable:

   ```bash
   ./hello_world
   ```
